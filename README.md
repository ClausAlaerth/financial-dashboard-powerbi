# Financial Dashboard with Power BI

This dashboard is finance related, containing information per the available banks, total transactions,  brute revenue, expenses, taxes, liquid profit and various analysis based on these, and more, calculations. Of course, precise data was achieved by the use of DAX, in particular the use of CALCULATE with conditionals using COUNTROWS.

A sizeable part of this dashboard was made with custom indicators. Using the DAX results in addition with Image Grid, Scroller and Enlighten Data Story, all available on Microsoft Appsource, this dash was able to make use of slicers using images instead of checks, dynamic storytelling whichâ€”of course, changes according to the highlighted indicator, and finally, a scrolling margin quote price banner.
